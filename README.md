If you don't know how to use this OS here's a list of commands(Or you could type help):
help:   show help
new:    new file
exec:   run python file
read:   show file contents
info:   show info
Q:      Quit
And for those unfortunate enough to run into these errors:
Err01: File not found 
Err02:  Syntax error in inputted command
Err03: This one is specific to the EXEC command. It means it could be a file not found error or an syntax error in your python code.
And if I do something wrong you should get a crash report. It will say something like this:
pios encountered a critical error. Please contact the dev on GitHub.
